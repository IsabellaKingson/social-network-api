# Social Network API

## Description

This is the backend for a social network. This is the database and network connections as well as the routes for creating users, posts and reactions. Throught this project I learned how to use MongoDB. I had a lot of challenges with this project, but I feel proud of my efforts to overcome my comprehension difficulties and persevere.
